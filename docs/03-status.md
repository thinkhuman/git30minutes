# Step 3: Check Status and Make Changes

While you're working, you'll often want to know: what's the status of my project files? Did I already stage this file? Are there files I haven't started tracking yet? 

**A: Check the status of your project**

In the `example-project` directory, check the status of your repository:

`git status`

This will list which files are staged, unstaged, or untracked.

**B: Modify Files and Commit Again**

Make a few changes to `README.md`. When you're done, stage and commit those changes:

**Stage**: `git add README.md`

 **Commit**: `git commit -m "Update README with project information"`

<div style="page-break-after: always; break-after: page;"></div>
