# Command Line Crash Course

The _command line_ is just a way to manually enter text commands in an application called a _terminal_. Instead of clicking on icons or using a graphical interface, you type commands into the terminal and receive text responses. This can be a powerful way to perform tasks, especially for tasks that don't have a graphical interface.

*   To execute a command, type it in the terminal application and press `Enter` or `Return`.
*   The `Tab` key can be used for auto-completing file names or commands.
*   `Command (âŒ˜)` (or `Ctrl`) + `C` can be used to stop a running command.
*   The `up` and `down` arrow keys allow you to cycle through your previously used commands.

IMPORTANT: The commands below are specific to MacOS and other Unix-based systems. Commands on Windows differ slightly than Unix-based systems; for a quick Windows-specific command line tutorial, [see this one](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/command-line-commands-cli-tutorial/). 

The most common commands you'll use are:

1.  **`cat`**: Displays the content of a file or concatenates multiple files.

    *   Example: `cat file.txt`

2.  **`cd`**: Changes the current directory.

    *   Example: `cd Documents` to go to the Documents directory.

3.  **`cp`**: Copies files or directories.

    *   Example: `cp source.txt destination.txt` to copy source.txt to destination.txt.

4.  **`ls`**: Lists all files and directories in the current directory.

    *   Example: `ls`

5.  **`man`**: Displays the manual page for other commands.

    *   Example: `man ls` to see the manual for the `ls` command.

6.  **`mkdir`**: Creates a new directory.

    *   Example: `mkdir NewFolder` to create a new folder named "NewFolder".

7.  **`mv`**: Moves or renames files or directories.

    *   Example: `mv oldname.txt newname.txt` to rename a file.

8.  **`pwd`**: Displays the path of the current working directory.

    *   Example: `pwd`

9.  **`rm`**: Removes files or directories.

    *   Example: `rm file.txt` to remove a file named "file.txt".

10. **`touch`**: Creates a new, empty file.
